Frontend Test
Phase 1 - Static Website
Design to static HTML/CSS website

Description: 
Your company is looking for a new website. The agency is planning to have a lightweight and pretty website. It should have implemented the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. It should be static, with only HTML and CSS, because the focus is on speed. The web application will contain

The HTML5 tags for the structure(<header>, <footer>).
Different CSS approaches for page organisation, such as CSS Grid, flexbox, etc.
Optimised and lightweight images.
As little CSS code as possible.
The front end is to be as pixel-perfect as possible with the design.
The website structure should be compatible with the latest standards. For example, adding an image without the ALT attribute is terrible for SEO.
The CSS code should be well structured.

Workflow:
The design will be on invision. You will need to export the sizes and colours using these tools. After exporting the elements, you must implement those carefully on the website. Keeping in mind the page structure, add each “row” to a new section. Try to make as much reusable code as possible. For example, for buttons, you need to have a “basic” CSS class in which you add the essential attributes similar to most buttons and then add other classes and attributes for more specific needs.

Before Starting The Work:
Review the design here.
You will need to build ONLY these two sections:
Top
Bottom.
The three images section should be done with a CSS-Grid layout
This section should be done with a flexbox
For Images, use placeholders https://placeholderimage.dev/  http://via.placeholder.com/2550x550 


Phase 2 - Static to Dynamic
Implement Javascript
Description: 
After the static website was published, the client noticed it needed to be more complex. We need to add some elements to have the client interact with them. The client would like to add dynamic content that will be changeable according to user commands. Initially, the website should contain:

A carousel. This section should be a carousel.

User flow:
Feel free to build the carousel yourself. If you need to use an external jQuery plugin, use GlideJS


Phase 3 - Mobile 
Turn the desktop design into a responsive design.

Description: 
After some time, the client gets too many complaints that the website looks awful on mobile and that the user cannot interact with it. Moreover, on analytics, we have seen that more than 60% of the users are on mobile. Therefore, we must make the website responsive and look good on mobile. These features consist of:

The carousel should be adaptive and related to the screen size. For example, we will show only one image on small devices, two on tablets, etc.
The header will be redesigned.
The page content should be organised differently on mobile. From multiple columns on the desktop to one-column 
The footer will be the same as the design. It should be re-designed.
Before Starting The Work:
Homepage
When the work is finished:
If any features listed in the description need to be added or the user flow needs to be as described, the work will be evaluated based on what works.
